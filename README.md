3. **Customer Service**: Enhance customer interactions by gauging and responding to emotional cues.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **conda Python 3.7.16** installed on your system.
- **Docker** installed for containerized deployment.

### Installation Guide

1. **Download Docker**

    Ensure you have Docker installed on your system. You can download it [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

2. **Download Anaconda**

    Install Anaconda for easy management of Python environments. Download it [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

3. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdamRayann/Final_Project.git

4. **Install Python 3.7.16:**
   Create a new environment with Python 3.7.16 using Anaconda:

   ```bash
   conda create -n myenv python=3.7.16

Then, activate the environment:

        conda activate myenv


5. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
***Note: Ensure you install the specific versions listed in requirements.txt to avoid compatibility issues. Alternatively, you can install each dependency manually, matching the specified versions.***
 
6. **Start Docker:**

    Make sure Docker is running on your system to enable container-based features.

7. **Run the Application**:

    Simply executing the main script will initiate the entire system . The initial setup may take a bit of time, depending on your internet speed. So, relax and grab a mug of coffee while it loads ;D
